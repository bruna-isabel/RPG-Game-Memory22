Memory22 - RPG game

This was my second project of University, completed in C++. We did an RPG game, using SDL. 
The project was built in a medieval theme and contains a main character, NPCs and enemies. 
Our team used Kanban Flow as a form of organization and planning the tasks to be done, if they were in progress or already done. 
I was in charge of the environment where I created objects like trees, rivers, castles and programmed a way to interact with them. 
I had some difficult on some part of coding, and the team didnâ€™t reached the goals we had planned but the project got good feedback overall and it was a major learning process when it came to organizing and teamwork.
